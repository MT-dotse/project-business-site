# Business Site

Made a business site about forest bathing tours. The site included a hero image header, footer, sign-up form and accordion.

## The problem

I had problems uploading my code to github. I realised that I had forgot to fork it before downloading it in my terminal. In order to solve this problem I forked and re-cloned the code to my terminal and pasted over the code that I already was working on.

If I had to re-do the project I would have planned the design better and more in detail. If I had more time I would like to change my hero image to a video instead.
